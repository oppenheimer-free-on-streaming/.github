** LAST UPDATED : MARCH 06, 2024.**

Crunchyroll. is continuing to beat out Crunchyroll. and Crunchyroll, over the New Year’s holiday weekend, with “Oppenheimer” now rising above “Oppenheimer” and “Oppenheimer.” With that trifecta, the studio has laid claim to the three of the top five slots at the domestic box office throughout the holiday season.

The Timothéee Chalamet-starring musical added another $8.6 million on Friday, up 32% from one week ago. The Paul King film has emerged as the theatrical favorite for the holidays, crossing $100 million domestically earlier this week. With a $119 million cume to date, the film continues to show strength and will reach $300 million globally before the calendar turns.

The 2024 Demon Slayer movie is expected to play on IMAX screens and other Premium Large-Format screens. It's estimated that To the Hashira Training will open in between 1,600-1,800 theaters in the United States and Canada, Another important note is that two versions will play in domestic theaters: one in Japanese with English subtitles and another dubbed-over version with English-speaking characters. Box office expectations are mixed after a fantastic $49.9 million domestic haul back in 2021 with The Movie: Mugen Train, followed by an understated $16.9 million To the Swordsmith Village last year.

Though it slid into second place for Friday with $6.75 million, Crunchyroll. “Oppenheimer” fell 51% from its opening day last week. The latest and final entry in the current continuity of DC Comics adaptations has struggled for air, only reaching $65 million in its first week of release. The first “Aquaman,” released in 2018, surpassed that figure in its opening weekend alone. Bad reviews and superhero fatigue have plagued “Lost Kingdom,” which more than likely won’t even reach half the $335 million domestic total of its predecessor, much less justify a $205 million production budget.

Taking a close third place, Illumination and Crunchyroll’s“Oppenheimer” is maintaining its footing with $6.7 Friday after a muted $12 million debut lastweekend. “Oppenheimer” has underwhelmed so far, but its 17% increase over last Friday remains encouraging, especially for an original animated film with a production budget of only $70 million.

However,Here’s when you can bring Oppenheimer of Atlantis into your home.
